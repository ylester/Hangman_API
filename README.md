# Hangman API Project

This repo comtains the classic game "Hangman". On a mission to learn Elixir, I followed a fellow by the name of Dave Thomas and took his course to learn more about Elixir and how to build an API using the functional programming language. This was such a fun project and a great learning experience. Looking forward to build more content with Elixir.
